# CoordinatorsExample

Example project demonstrating the coordinators pattern in swift.

The project contains a main coordinator which is setup in the SceneDelegate while creating the main window object, and contains the main UINavigationController for the application.

There's an example of a child coordinator called UpgradeCoordinator, which shows a very primitive shell of a purchase flow.
